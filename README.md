# Dementia Data Analysis Study

## Overview
Welcome to the Dementia Data Analysis Study repository. This project aims to analyze the official dataset provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) using various tools such as SQL, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Excel. The study focuses on different aspects of dementia, including the nature of cognitive decline, ethical and social implications of dementia care, and advances in early detection and intervention strategies.

## Analysis Topics

### Topic 1: The Nature of Dementia's Cognitive Decline
In this analysis, we delve into the nature of dementia's cognitive decline. Our results indicate that there has been a significant increase of 0.10 in alcohol consumption over the last 5 years compared to the first 5 years. Additionally, we found that men performed less physical activity in 2016.

### Topic 2: Ethical and Social Implications of Dementia Care
This segment explores the ethical and social implications of dementia care. Our findings suggest that there are more awareness campaigns related to dementia than risk prevention initiatives.

### Topic 3: Advances in Early Detection and Intervention Strategies
The third topic focuses on advances in early detection and intervention strategies for dementia. Notably, we discovered that Australia leads with the highest number of published research papers on this topic. Among the top 5 countries with the most research, three are European countries (France, Netherlands, Sweden), with Japan ranking second.
